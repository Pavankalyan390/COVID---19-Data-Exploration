# 📊 COVID-19 Data Exploration with SQL
## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL.

The dataset includes information about cases, deaths, and vaccinations.

The goal is to analyze key metrics such as:

- Infection rates
- Death percentages
- Vaccination progress
- Global trends

## 🔹Key Insights

- Identified countries with the highest infection rate vs. population
- Analyzed death counts per country & continent
- Tracked global case and death trends

# 📂 Dataset
The data comes from Our World in Data – COVID-19 dataset.

Two tables are used:

- CovidDeaths → contains location, date, cases, deaths, and population.
- CovidVaccinations → contains vaccination records.

# ⚙️SQL Techniques Used

- CAST() and CONVERT() for datatype conversions
- Aggregate functions (SUM, MAX)
- Window functions (OVER, PARTITION BY)
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Temporary tables
- Views for visualization

# Next step
- Extend analysis with trends over time (moving averages, growth rates)

# 💡Outcome: 
*This project not only strengthened my SQL skills but also showed how raw data can be transformed into meaningful insights.*
